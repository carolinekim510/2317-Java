<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the official web site for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<center>
<h2><strong>Typographical Errors</strong></h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.

<h2 align="center">Source Code and Class Files</h2>

<p>You will find a source code file for the driver class for the program 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<p>You will also find compiled class files for my version of the program in that 
same zip file. Run my version of the program side-by-side with your version and 
compare your output with my output to make sure they match before 
submitting your assignment.</p>

<center>
<h2><strong>Java and Media Library Version Requirement</strong></h2>
</center>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the accompanying document 
titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments</strong> and in the syllabus for this course.</p>
<h2 class="style2">Generics</h2>
<p>You must use Generics when you write your program for this assignment. If I 
see anything similar to the following when I compile your program, you will not 
receive credit for the program.</p>
<pre>Note: .\Proj03Runner.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.</pre>

<p>Among other things, this assignment involves:
 </p>
<ul>
	<li>Working with collections.</li>
	<li>Working with the Collection interface and concrete 
  implementations of the interface.
 </li>
	<li>Working with the Iterator interface. </li>
	<li>Using skills learned in previous assignments.</li>
</ul>
		<p>There are no graphic output images required by this program. Therefore, it can be compiled and executed without a requirement to have Ericson's media library on the classpath.

</p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Write a program named Proj03 that uses the class definition contained 
		in the file named Proj03.java to produce text output as described below.</p>
	  <p>Your challenge is to examine the code in the file named Proj03.java 
	  along with the output text shown below to deduce the algorithm required to 
	  produce that output and to implement that algorithm in a file named 
	  Proj03Runner.java.</p>
	  <p>The output text for any given run will depend on the input value 
	  provided as a command-line parameter. The text shown below was produced by 
	  five consecutive runs of the program for input values of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 
	  respectively. I will test your program with a different undisclosed input 
	  value. You can test your program by running your version and my version 
	  side-by-side and comparing the results for any input value that you choose.</p>
		<p>You must define a new class named Proj03Runner. You may define other new classes as necessary to cause your program to behave as required, but you may not modify the class definition for the class named 
		Proj03.
